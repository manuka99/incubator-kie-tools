/**
 * Compares two boxed expressions and returns a structured diff representing their differences.
 *
 * This is the main entry point for diffing boxed expressions. It handles type changes
 * (expression replacements) and delegates to specialized diff functions for each expression type.
 *
 * @param exprA - The base model expression to compare
 * @param exprB - The changed model expression to compare
 * @param opts - Options for the diff algorithm
 * @returns A BoxedExpressionDiff object describing the differences, or undefined if expressions are identical
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Returns undefined if both expressions are undefined (no change)
 * - Returns an "expressionReplacement" diff if the expression types differ
 * - Delegates to type-specific diff functions (diffDecisionTable, diffContext, etc.) for same-type comparisons
 * - Supports all DMN boxed expression types: literal, decision table, context, function definition,
 *   list, invocation, relation, conditional, filter, every, some, and for expressions
